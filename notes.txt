Current Flourish implementation:
    - pass in "/inbox" directory
    - write first record of csv
        - loop through all days and add each day to row
    
    - call parseConversation on each conversation directory
        - find first json file
        - if 2 participants keep going
        - for each day:
            - loop through conversation and tally up messages
            - append count to that day's column in the row
